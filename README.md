# LazerMaze

Lazer Maze is a game in which consists of a complex maze and few lazer guns. Lazer guns fires till first obstacle (maze wall or other lazer gun).
Goal is to find shortest path from source to destination. 
On each move Lazer guns will change there direction in clockwise. Current location (user location) could not come in lazer path.

- I have used BFS to find optimimal solution.
- Have used heuristic algorithms also, but for complex maze these algorithms tends to fall in local minima.
